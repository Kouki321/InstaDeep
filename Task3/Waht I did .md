so i use Dependency Injection (DI) in the endpoint task3 mohamed amine kouki
at first i create a spring boot then add those to dependecy
jpa ,spring dev tool , spring security ...
so at first i creat the entity of the task 
then the the repo who is going to changethe data and interact with myssl
then i create the controller and service 
(the service will communicate with repo and the controller)
(i was going to make restIMpl and also serviceImpl for best practice but i didn t have much time and also it a simple task why make it more complexe )
then i creat the creatTask controller (btw the port 8055) then i create the delete ,and find all and also dind all te category the update (the update still need more devlopmenet)
if u use postman just copy the scret code and go basic in token and add it the name is user
and Thank you
